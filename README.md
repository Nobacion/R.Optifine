# R.Optifine
a small python code that modifies the privileges of RobloxPlayerBeta depending on its state.

If RobloxPlayerBeta is minimized: Normal
If a different app is being used: Normal
If RobloxPlayerBeta is interacting (the user is playing roblox): Above normal

This difference in privileges is for better performance of the RobloxPlayerBeta.exe process
